# CP2106 Independent Software Development Project (Orbital)
Orbital project in 2023 taken under NUS.
Orbital provides a platform for students to gain hands-on industrial experience for computing technologies related to students’ own interests. Done in pairs of two, Orbital students propose, design, execute, implement and market their project to peers and faculty. Peer assessment and critique of others’ projects are key components of the courses’ deliverables.

## About
With the introduction of our mobile app, ChopeLB, we will be able to implement an efficient seat allocation system that will help students who are just looking for a quick revision break to save time and avoid the hassle of searching for an available seat upon arrival at the library.
Students will be able to reserve seats in the library easily and conveniently. With just a few clicks in our app, users will be able to browse through the available seats in the library, select a seat that meets their preferences, and reserve it for a specific time period. This app strives to utilise the library’s capacity to hold more students and in turn, benefitting more students in the long run.
